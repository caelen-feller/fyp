# Final Year Mathematics Project
Code and literature for my 4th year project in mathematics with Trinity College Dublin, supervised by Prof. Kirk Soodhalter.   

The project focuses on the development of methods proposed by [Gopal and Trefethen (2019)](http://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/trefethen/laplaceSINUM.pdf), and their [Lighting Laplace Solver](http://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/trefethen/lightning.html). 

Also included will be reference implementations and benchmarks using competing methods.


## Current Goals:

 - Re-implement method proposed by paper.
 - Merge features of existing implementation.
 - Extend implementation and theory to handle: 
   - Non-Dirichlet boundary conditions
   - Discontinous boundary conditions
   - Non-connected domains
   - Elongated domains
   - Slits in domains
 - Benchmark solutions against traditional methods where possible.
