# Final Year Mathematics Project
Code and literature for my 4th year project in mathematics with Trinity College Dublin, supervised by Prof. Kirk Soodhalter.   

The project focuses on the development of methods proposed by [Gopal and Trefethen (2019)](http://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/trefethen/laplaceSINUM.pdf), and their [Lighting Laplace Solver](http://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/trefethen/lightning.html). 

Also included will be reference implementations and benchmarks using competing methods.


## Goals of Project:

 - Re-implement method proposed by paper 
 - Merge features of existing implementation 
 - Extend implementation and theory to handle: 
   - Discontinous boundary conditions 
   - Curved boundaries 
   - Non-Dirichlet boundary conditions 
 - Benchmark solutions against traditional methods where possible
